## Prereqs
- Cloud access to GCP and Azure
- No PHI/PII; smallest/free-tier shapes

## Google Cloud (GCP)
### Create
1. Console → Compute Engine → Create instance
2. Region/zone: us-east4 (Northern Virginia) zone: any
3. Machine type: e2-micro (2 vCPU, 1 core, 1 GB memory)
4. Image: Ubuntu 25.04 Minimal
5. Boot disk: default minimal
6. Network: default VPC; ephemeral public IP

### Start/Stop
- Start:

- Stop: <state shows TERMINATED/STOPPED>

### Delete
- Delete instance and verify no disks/IPs remain

## Azure
### Create
1. Compartment: virtual machine -> create 
2. Region/Availability Zone:  (US) East US 2
3. Machine Size: Standard_B1s-1 vcpu, 1 Gib memory
4. Image: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS -x64 Gen2
5. Authentication type: password
6. Boot volume: default minimal

### Start/Stop
- Start: <state shows RUNNING>

- Stop: <state shows STOPPED>

### Terminate
- Terminate and delete boot volume; verify cleanup

## Reflections
### Similarities
- Both had the Ubuntu LTS that I used for my assignment (and other Linux distros) for lightweight testing.
-Both asked you to identify a region and zone for where the VM runs. 
-The setup process was similar because both platforms guide you through multiple sections step by step to create the VM.
-Indicated status of the computer. (Running, stopped, terminated)


### Differences
-Azure has a “resources group” whereas GCP did not organize the VMs and other related assets. 
-Azure allows you to pick the Virtual Network and subnet, and GCP gives you a default VPC network. 
-Azure presents more configuration steps and are less hidden than GCP.
-Azure assigns a public IP that can persist, while GCP typically uses a temporary IP that’s released once the VM is deleted.


### Preference (Azure vs GCP) and Why
As a beginner, I found myself to prefer GCP over Azure because it was more straightforward and clear. As briefly mentioned in contrasting the two above, I saw that GCP had more pre-configured defaults already set which made the whole process feel cleaner and less overwhelming since I could create a VM quickly without having to worry about any excess configuration. Although I did leave many things at default in Azure, there were more options presented to me to read through. Since the tabs were structured in sequential order, I found myself spending more time clicking and reading through the sections even if I was not changing much. While this could be useful for someone with more experience, I found myself a little more confused when creating the VM. I believe since GCP had more different settings across the hamburger, you had to click around more if you wanted to customize, and that made the process for creating and running a VM feel more approachable.
